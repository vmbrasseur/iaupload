# iaupload

## NAME

`iaupload` - Upload files to [Internet Archive](http://archive.org).

## SYNOPSIS

`iaupload`

## DESCRIPTION

`iaupload` is a Python script I'm using to upload files to the [San Francisco Perl Mongers Collection on Internet Archive](http://archive.org/details/sfperlmongers).

This script uses the [internetarchive Python Library](https://github.com/jjjake/ia-wrapper).

As of the initial commit of this script, many important bits of information are hardcoded:

* Item identifier
* Files to upload
* Location/name of the configuration file
* Location/name of the metadata file
* Etc.

Eventually these will all be parameterized and configurable at the command line. Please check the issues in this repo if you'd like to help with that work.

## EXAMPLE

Edit script to set variables accordinglyâ€¦then:

```
iaupload
```
